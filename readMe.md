# Exode cli

Exnode is a cli tool used to start express typescript projects. It also has an option
to drop down to plain vanilla javascript. It helps set things up so that you as the developer can focus
more on development rather than annoying setup for every new project.

# Usage

> To start an express app with typescript

```
npx exode init appname
```

if you have it installed globally

```
exode init appname
```

> To strip down to plain Javascript

```
npx exode init appname -js
```

or

```
npx exode init appname --javascript
```

and if installed globally

```
exode init appname -js
```

or

```
exode init appname --javascript
```
