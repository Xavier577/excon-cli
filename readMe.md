# Excon cli

Excon is a cli tool used to start express typescript projects. It also has an option
to drop down to plain vanilla javascript. It helps set things up so that you as the developer can focus
more on development rather than annoying setup for every new project.

# Usage

```
npx excon init appname
```

if you have it installed globally

```
excon init appname
```

> To strip down to plain Javascript

```
npx excon init appname -js
```

or

```
npx excon init appname --javascript
```

and if installed globally

excon init appname -js
```
